            I've always been a maker of things.
            Inspired by the creativity that exists in the spectacular everyday people I meet,
            I hope to further my own abilities as a developer, artist, and programmer.

                        Ever since I booted up Roblox for the first time on the old family PC, I've wanted to make games.
                        Now, I do.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I program mainly with C# in the Unity engine, create and animate sprites with Aseprite, and compose music 
                        with the Reaper DAW and various plugins. This is just a showcase of my best works, you can find every 
                        game I've built on my Itch.io page.
                    </p>    

                    <p>
                        Game development is especially challenging as a solo developer - AKA the game designer, programmer, art director, 
                        music producer, and marketer, all at once.
                        Though I'm making progress, I am nowhere near the height of my potential, and
                        I fully intend to build many more games for years to come.

                                A short exploration and light horror game where I took a more poetic, artistic 
                                perspective on game development, focusing on atmosphere and symbolism 
                                to tell a story about diving into the depths.

                                A quick and intense astroid defense game designed to only need the spacebar to play. 
                                Built within 48 hours for Mini Jam 162: Heat, with the creative limitation of only one button performing two actions. 
                                Ranked top 5 out of 139 total entries. This was my first 48-hour game jam so I didn't expect the high placement, but a win is a win.

                                This was my first go at a true independent creation without needing to follow a tutorial, and I think 
                                it went very well as far as first times go.

                        <p>
                            I'm currently a CS major at Purdue University. 
                            So far, I've programmed some small arcade style videogames: right now, I'm learning web development. 
                            When I'm not working on projects or studying, I like to write poems, hit the gym, 
                            play games (OG reinhardt main) and go out with friends.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I found my love for creating early on, through building with legos and writing short stories. 
                            After the pandemic left me feeling lost and unsure, finding avenues to express myself and figure out 
                            my identity helped me to heal. As a result, you will find touches of my personality, values, 
                            and humor in everything I create. For whatever reason brought you here, thanks for stopping by!
