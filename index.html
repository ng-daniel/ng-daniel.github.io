            For as long as I can remember, I've been a maker of things.
            Inspired by the creativity that exists in spectacular everyday people,
            I see the world through the lens of a scientist, artist, and innovator.

                        Ever since I booted up Roblox for the first time back in third grade, I've wanted to make games.
                        Now, I do.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I program mainly with C# in the Unity engine, create and animate sprites with Aseprite, and compose music 
                        with the Reaper DAW and various plugins. This is just a showcase of my best works, you can find every 
                        game I've built on my Itch.io page.
                    </p>    

                    <p>
                        Game development is especially challenging as a solo developer - AKA the game designer, programmer, art director, 
                        music producer, and marketer, all at once.
                        Though I'm making progress, I am nowhere near the height of my potential, and
                        I fully intend to build many more games for years to come.

                                A short exploration and light horror game where, a mother whale, you must explore the caves 
                                and deep waters to find your missing calf.
                                For this game I took a more poetic, artistic perspective on game development, focusing on
                                atmosphere and symbolism. 
                                into game development to tell a story about diving into the depths. 
                                Built within 7 days for Brackeys Game Jam 2023.2.

                                A quick and intense astroid defense game designed to only need the spacebar to play. 
                                Built within 48 hours for Mini Jam 162: Heat, with the creative limitation of only one button performing two actions. 
                                Ranked top 5 out of 139 total entries. This was my first 48-hour game jam so I didn't expect the high placement, but a win is a win.

                                A classic shoot-em-up action game with dodge rolls, unique enemies, and bossfights.

                                This was my first go at a true independent creation without needing to follow a tutorial, and I think 
                                it went very well as far as first times go.

                        I'm currently a CS major at Purdue University. 
                        So far, I've programmed some small arcade style videogames. 
                        When I'm not working, I like to write poems, hit the gym, 
                        play games (OG reinhardt main) and go out with friends.

                        I found my love for creating early on, through building with legos and writing short stories. 
                        After the pandemic left me feeling lost and unsure, finding avenues to express myself and figure out 
                        my identity helped me to heal. As a result, you will find touches of my personality, values, 
                        and humor in everything I create. For whatever reason brought you here, thanks for stopping by!
